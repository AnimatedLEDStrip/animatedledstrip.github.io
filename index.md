## Getting Started

AnimatedLEDStrip gives you many options for how you integrate it into your project.

If you want a solution that works right out of the box, then take a look at the [Raspberry Pi Server](/server.html#raspberry-pi-server) and the [AnimatedLEDStrip clients](/clients).

## Features

The AnimatedLEDStrip project comes with many features, including:

- Controlling a LED strip and changing the pixel's colors
- Controlling multi-dimensional LED matrices and fields by specifying a location for each pixel
- Running animations on the LEDs, including running multiple animations simultaneously
- Customizing how those animations are run
- Identifying sections of the strip that can be controlled as if they were an independent strip
- An HTTP server that clients can communicate with
