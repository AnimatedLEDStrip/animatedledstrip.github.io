|Parameter|Type|Default Value|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|interMovementDelay|`Int`|`30`|Delay between movements in the animation|
|movementPerIteration|`Double`|`1.0`|How far to move during each iteration of the animation|

## Description
Wipes a plane through all pixels, leaving behind colors[0].

Note: Two-dimensional operation requires plane to be rotated around the X axis (probably by Pi/2 radians in most use cases)
