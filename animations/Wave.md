|:-:|:-:|
|name|`Wave`|
|abbr|`WAV`|
|runCountDefault|Endless|
|minimum colors|`1`|
|unlimited colors|`false`|
|dimensionality|`[ONE_DIMENSIONAL, TWO_DIMENSIONAL, THREE_DIMENSIONAL]`|

|Parameter|Type|Default Value|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|interMovementDelay|`Int`|`30`|Delay between movements in the animation|
|interAnimationDelay|`Int`|`500`|Time between start of one animation and start of the next|
|movementPerIteration|`Double`|`1.0`|How far to move during each iteration of the animation|
|rotation|`Rotation`|`RadiansRotation(xRotation=0.0, yRotation=0.0, zRotation=0.0, rotationOrder=[ROTATE_Z, ROTATE_X])`|Rotation of the plane around the XYZ axes|

## Description
Wipes a plane through all pixels, leaving a fading trail behind.

Note: Two-dimensional operation requires plane to be rotated around the X axis (probably by Pi/2 radians in most use cases)
