## Description
Watch pixels race each other along the strip.
A color is chosen randomly, then a pixel is sent down the strip.
After waiting for up to `maxInterAnimationDelay` milliseconds, another pixel is sent.

Note that in the animation signature that there are a couple points where the slope of the line gets shallower (meaning the pixel is 'moving' faster).
If you look closely, you'll see that there are actually two [Pixel Run](Pixel-Run) subanimations at the same spot engaged in a race condition - quite fitting for this animation.
This happens because when an animation such as Pixel Run changes a pixel's temporary color, it puts a lock on that pixel so the pixel's color doesn't change until it's done with that pixel.
