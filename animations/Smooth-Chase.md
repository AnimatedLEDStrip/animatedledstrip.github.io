## Description
Each pixel is set to its respective color in `colors[0]`.
Then, if the direction is `Direction.FORWARD`, each pixel is set to `colors[0][i + 1]`, then `colors[0][i + 2]`, etc. to create the illusion that the animation is 'moving'.
If the direction is `Direction.BACKWARD`, the same happens but with indices `i`, `i-1`, `i-2`, etc.
Works best with a ColorContainer with multiple colors.
