# AnimatedLEDStrip Core Library

The AnimatedLEDStrip core library handles:

- Changing the pixels' colors
- Tracking the location in 3D space of each pixel (even for 1- and 2-dimensional arrangements)
- Running animations on the LEDs, including running multiple animations simultaneously
- Specifying how these animations can be customized
- Creating sections of the strip that can be controlled as if they were an independent strip
