{"name":"AnimatedLEDStrip","tagline":"","body":"# AnimatedLEDStrip\r\nThe AnimatedLEDStrip set of libraries are meant to make the process of running animations on a LED strip much easier.\r\nThis library also supports running concurrent animations on a LED strip. Multiple animations can be run simultaneously, even over the same part of the strip. See the [wiki](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStrip/wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Structure\r\nThe libraries are designed so you have multiple options for how you integrate AnimatedLEDStrip into your project.\r\n- If you want to have a solution that works out of the box with minimal effort, then you can install the [server-pi](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStrip#raspberry-pi-server) on a Raspberry Pi and use one of the client examples to control it\r\n- If you want to make your program into a client, you can import the [AnimatedLEDStripClient](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStrip/blob/master/README.md#client) library.\r\nExamples of this include the [Android app](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStrip#android-client) and the [Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Client](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStrip#raspberry-pi-touchscreen-client).\r\nMultiple languages are supported, see the library for details.\r\n- If you want to control the strip directly from a Kotlin/Java program, you can import the device library for your device\r\n  - If your device isn't supported, you can [create a new device library](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStripServer/wiki)\r\n\r\n### Main Libraries\r\nThe main set of libraries includes:\r\n#### [Core](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStrip)\r\nContains all the animations and generic structure for communicating with LED strips.\r\n\r\n#### [Server](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/server)\r\nA library for running a server that runs animations on a LED strip.\r\nThe server communicates with clients to start and end animations.\r\nAlso contains a command line interface that can be used to monitor and partially control the server.\r\nTo create an executable server, this library is combined with a device library and a short main method (see the [Raspberry Pi Server](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStrip#raspberry-pi-server) for an example).\r\n\r\n#### [Client](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStripClient) \r\nA library for communicating with a server by sending JSON over socket connections.\r\nSee library for a list of supported languages.\r\n\r\n### Device Libraries\r\nEach device that can run LEDs has its own device library.\r\nCurrently the only device supported is the Raspberry Pi, but this can be [expanded to more devices](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/server/wiki) in the future:\r\n- [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/device-pi) - A device library for running\r\nLEDs on a Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ or 4B\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n#### [Raspberry Pi Server](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/server-pi)\r\nThis repository contains an example implementation of a server for a Raspberry Pi.\r\nThis can be used as-is with no modification, or can be used as a template for creating servers on Raspberry Pis or other devices.\r\nThe repository includes support for installation using [`ansible-pull`](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStripPiServerExample#install), further simplifying the install process.\r\n\r\n#### [Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Client](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStripGUI)\r\nThis repository contains an example of a GUI that uses the AnimatedLEDStripClient library to communicate with an AnimatedLEDStripServer.\r\nBuilt with [TornadoFX](https://tornadofx.io/), it is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with the official 7\" touchscreen, though it can be run on any device with Java 8 and JavaFX installed.\r\n\r\n#### [Android Client](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStripAndroidControl)\r\nAn Android app that uses the AnimatedLEDStripClient library to communicate with an AnimatedLEDStripServer.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n#### [Arduino Library](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStripCppArduino)\r\nAlso included in the set of libraries is one written in C++ for Arduinos.\r\nThis is the library that started AnimatedLEDStrip.\r\nSee our [history](https://github.com/AnimatedLEDStrip/AnimatedLEDStrip/wiki#history) for more details.","note":"Don't delete this file!
